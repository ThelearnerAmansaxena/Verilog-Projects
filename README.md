# Verilog Projects – Samir Palnitkar Book Exercises

This repository contains Verilog HDL exercises based on the book:

📘 **"Verilog HDL: A Guide to Digital Design and Synthesis" by Samir Palnitkar**

---

## 🧾 Overview

This is a personal initiative to strengthen my Verilog fundamentals through practical implementation. Each exercise is simulated to reinforce concepts from the book.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Exercises are organized chapter-wise. Each folder will contain Verilog code, and where needed, testbenches or notes. More structured content and projects will be added as I progress.

---

## 🧪 Simulation

- Simulations are performed using **[EDA Playground](https://edaplayground.com/)**.
- Links to simulations may be included as comments in the code.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build a strong Verilog and digital design foundation  
- Prepare for embedded/VLSI roles and interviews  
- Create a clean and public learning archive
